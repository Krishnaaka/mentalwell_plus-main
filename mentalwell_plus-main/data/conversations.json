One approach is to focus on increasing self-awareness and developing more effective coping mechanisms. Here's an actionable step for now:\n\nTake 5 minutes today to practice a simple mindfulness exercise, such as focusing on your breath or noticing the sensations in your body without judgment. You can find many guided recordings online or download a free app like Headspace or Calm. This can help you become more present and better equipped to handle challenging emotions.\n\nRemember, you don't have to go through this alone. If you feel comfortable, we can explore other topics or strategies further in our conversation.
